# OpenXR UX Unity Base### A set of UX tools for use with OpenXR.This has been created for the students at the University of Auckland Smart Digital Lab to use as a base for their projects.  As such, it is intended not only to be a drop-in-and-go library, but also to be used as a guide for students new to Unity and new to c# programming.  Therefore, much of the code is heavily commented and laid out according to a simple template in order to make it easy to understand.### Smart Digital Lab websitehttps://sdl.blogs.auckland.ac.nz ### Usage Instructions(coming soon)### Other people's licencesThere are some free assets included purely for demo purposes from the Asset Store (otherwise, it would be a really boring demo).  These are:* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/furniture/big-furniture-pack-7717* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vegetation/trees/free-trees-103208* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/nature/terrain-textures-pack-free-139542* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/nature/grass-flowers-pack-free-138810* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/steamvr-plugin-32647 (for vive and similar HMDs)Licences for these items are as per the licence terms on the Unity Asset Store and the respective asset owners and are thus not covered by the licence terms of this repository.  If in doubt, download them yourself from the Asset Store.All other packages included are either standard Unity packages (for example TextMeshPro and OpenXR), or created as part of this project.### QuestionsPlease direct all questions to sdl@auckland.ac.nz or roy.davies@auckland.ac.nz
